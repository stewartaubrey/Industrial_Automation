The purpose of revision 5 is to add messaging from the server back to the client

Changed client to add path to image at the shop and home.  Change by reversing comment

Changed server to prepend the XON character to the nc file before sending to CNC machine.  Idea is to kick start the CNC machine to begin receiving vs hanging.
