Steps to Create an Executable with PyInstaller

1. Install PyInstaller
   Open your command prompt and install PyInstaller using pip:
   pip install pyinstaller

2. Navigate to Your Script's Directory
   Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where your Python script is located. For example:
   cd path\to\your\script

3. Run PyInstaller
   Run PyInstaller with the --onefile option to create a single executable file:
   pyinstaller --onefile your_script.py
   - If your script has a GUI and you don't want a console window to appear, add the --windowed option:
     pyinstaller --onefile --windowed your_script.py

4. Locate the Executable
   After PyInstaller finishes, you'll find the executable in the dist directory within your script's directory.

5. Test the Executable
   Run the executable to ensure it works as expected. You can share this file with others, and they should be able to run it without needing Python installed.

Additional Tips
- Include Additional Files: If your script relies on other files (e.g., images, data files), you may need to modify the .spec file generated by PyInstaller to include these files.
- Custom Icons: You can add a custom icon to your executable using the --icon option:
  pyinstaller --onefile --icon=your_icon.ico your_script.py

Example
Here's an example command to create a single executable with a custom icon and no console window:
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon=myicon.ico myscript.py
