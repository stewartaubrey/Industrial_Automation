Steps to push new receiver file to ESP32

1. Save new version to file called "Current_Version.py"

2. Upload "Current_Version.py" using GUI

3. Use GUI to restart ESP32 which will run main.py

The main.py file on the ESP32 is set to run "Current_Version.py" on startup.
So update the "Current_Version.py" and then main will run it after startup.
